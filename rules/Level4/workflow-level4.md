## 🔄 INTEGRATION WITH MEMORY BANK

This workflow integrates comprehensively with Memory Bank:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Workflow["Level 4<br>Workflow"] --> PB["Comprehensive Update<br>projectbrief.md"]
    Workflow --> AC["Detailed Update<br>activeContext.md"]
    Workflow --> SP["Strategic Update<br>systemPatterns.md"]
    Workflow --> TC["Complete Update<br>techContext.md"]
    Workflow --> TM["Structured Maintenance<br>tasks.md"]
    Workflow --> PM["Enterprise Update<br>progress.md"]
    
    PB & AC & SP & TC & TM & PM --> MB["Memory Bank<br>Integration"]
    MB --> KT["Knowledge<br>Transfer"]
    KT --> NextSystem["Enterprise<br>System Evolution"]
```

## 🚨 LEVEL 4 GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLE

Remember:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Level 4 tasks represent ENTERPRISE-CRITICAL work.   │
│ RIGOROUS governance, comprehensive documentation,   │
│ and thorough verification are MANDATORY at each     │
│ phase. NO EXCEPTIONS.                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This ensures that complex systems are designed, implemented, and documented to the highest standards, with enterprise-grade quality and governance.
